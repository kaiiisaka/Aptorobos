                    My name is Alex, but you probably know me as snakefish.
                    I am a big fan of NFT art, a programmer and I am very
                    interested in everything related to the concept of web3.
                    I have been studying blockchain and cryptocurrencies
                    for a long time. I want to connect my life with it.
                    Even on my discord avatar, you see a picture that
                    was drawn by NTF artist Joiceeloo. <br />
                    I wanted to be part of the big Aptos network,
                    and finally found the right community! I tried many
                    times to compete with the guys from Aptoverse in quiz,
                    rumble, and other competitions, but the participants
                    here are so cool that they didnâ€™t leave me a chance!
                    I hope you found this site and what I wrote on it interesting.
                    I hope I can update it after more information about the project
                    becomes, because I'm not the coolest react developer yet. <br />
                    I would be grateful for any feedback!
